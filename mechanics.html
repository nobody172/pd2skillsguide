        <div class="mainContainerRight">
            <p> "Breakpoints" typically refers to thresholds for killing enemies in a certain number of shots. For example, a Heavy SWAT on the Overkill difficulty has x health, and takes x shots to kill from x weapon.
                By boosting the damage of a weapon, we can kill an enemy in 1 less shot, reaching the x shot breakpoint for Heavy SWATs on Overkill difficulty.

            <h1>Armor Gating</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="mainContainerRight">
            <p> "Armor Gating" is an "abuse" of the game's armor system to turn large amounts of damage into small amounts of damage. In Payday 2, armor and health are treated separately, meaning if
                you have 50 points of armor and full health, and you take a shot that would normally deal 150 damage, you would only take 50 damage, since that amount of damage would break your armor.
            </p>
            <p> We can abuse this mechanic by using skills such as Bullseye that restore a set amount of armor upon dealing damage. If you have 0 armor, hitting a headshot with Bullseye basic will bring you to 5 armor.
                That previously mentioned 150 damage shot will now only do 5 damage, since 5 damage is enough to break your armor. The fact that Bullseye only has a 1.5 second cooldown means
                your survivability will increase dramatically if you decide to pick it up.
            </p>
            <p> The one caveat of this strategy is that this armor mechanic doesn't apply to snipers, who deal full damage regardless of how much armor you have.

            <h1>Armor Regeneration</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="mainContainerRight">
            <p> Armor regeneration works slightly differently in Payday 2 than in other games. In most other games, "shield" or "armor" will rechange after a set amount of time if you don't take any damage.
                At first, this seems to be the case in Payday 2 as well. However, it's only half the truth.
            </p>
            <p> In Payday 2, your armor will only start its regeneration cooldown if you aren't taking damage <em>or being targeted by an enemy</em>. This is why your armor won't regenerate if you are being targeted by a SWAT turret.
                It also makes regeneration time a bit more inconsistent than it otherwise would be, since enemies can target you from long distances and interupt the cooldown.
