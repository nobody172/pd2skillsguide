        <h1>Perk Decks</h1>
    <main>
    <p>
        Perk decks are unlockable, selectable "decks" similar to skills that are integral to Payday 2 builds. There are 23 perk decks in Payday 2, all with different purposes, and some more effective than others.
    </p>
        <p>
            Each deck contains 9 cards, 4 which are common between all perk decks, and 5 that are unique to each deck.
        </p>
        <p>The 4 cards common between all decks provide the following benefits:</p>

                    Although the common cards are included in each perk deck, that doesn't mean they are created equally. "Helmet Popping" and "Fast and Furious" are nice free damage buffs for any build, and the ammo
                    pickup bonus provided by "Walk-in Closet" is always welcome. The major prize in these cards, however, is the 45% experience boost provided by "Blending In". This means that you obtain skill and perk points 45% faster
                    than you would otherwise, which is a substantial boost that shouldn't be overlooked. After unlocking this card on one perk deck, you should <em>never</em> use a different perk deck before unlocking this card first.
                </p>
                <p>The Armor bag, by contrast, is largely useless since most Payday 2 builds are suited for <em>either</em> stealth or loud, and not both. This means that your armor choice shouldn't be changing mid-heist.</p>

                    Crew Chief is all about team bonuses over individual bonuses. With a maxed-out deck, you provide 8% damage reduction, 50% extra stamina, 10% max health, and 5% max armor at all times for your teammates.
                    You also gain extra health and stamina for hostages, which is a nice boost. In loud, these buffs are noticeable, but not game-changing. In stealth, the extra stamina and shout distance are more than welcome, but
                    not so much that you would take this deck over Hacker or Burglar, which is the real issue with this deck as a whole. The opportunity cost of using this deck over other, more powerful decks is often too much to sacrifice.
                    That being said, Crew Chief is still strong enough to be usable on the highest difficulties.

                    Muscle is a pretty straightforward perk deck at first glance; you double your health pool, and regenerate 3% of it every 5 seconds. You're also more likely to be targeted, which makes sense since you have
                    so much extra health and free health regenetation. However, it's "Disturbing the Peace" that makes this deck unique. Perk decks that add a chance to spread panic typically require fast-firing weapons like LMGs or
                    even the flamethrower to reach their maximum effectiveness, which limits weapon choice and your effective range. Muscle is no exception, since the main utility
                    of this deck on higher difficulites <em>is</em> panic, since there are other decks that are better at helping you survive.

                    When it comes to simple perk decks in Payday 2, it doesn't really get simpler than Armorer. All armorer gives you is 35% extra armor, 20% faster armor recovery rate (half applies to teamates as well), and a 2-second invulnerability window
                    when your armor breaks. Yet, despite the simplicity and despite being one of the original perk decks, it's still one of the strongest options for loud to this day. The key to its strength lies in the 2-second invulnerability window.
                    2 seconds is more than enough time to get into cover when your armor breaks, or even to move between cover, and a 15-second cooldown isn't so long that you only have this ability once in a while. If you are using armorer,
                    you <em>will</em> be abusing the invulnerability, and you will also see great benefit from doing so.

                    When it comes to simple perk decks in Payday 2, it doesn't really get simpler than Armorer. All armorer gives you is 35% extra armor, 20% faster armor recovery rate (half applies to teamates as well), and a 2-second invulnerability window
                    when your armor breaks. Yet, despite the simplicity and despite being one of the original perk decks, it's still one of the strongest options for loud to this day. The key to its strength lies in the 2-second invulnerability window.
                    2 seconds is more than enough time to get into cover when your armor breaks, or even to move between cover, and a 15-second cooldown isn't so long that you only have this ability once in a while. If you are using armorer,
                    you <em>will</em> be abusing the invulnerability, and you will also see great benefit from doing so.

                    When it comes to simple perk decks in Payday 2, it doesn't really get simpler than Armorer. All armorer gives you is 35% extra armor, 20% faster armor recovery rate (half applies to teamates as well), and a 2-second invulnerability window
                    when your armor breaks. Yet, despite the simplicity and despite being one of the original perk decks, it's still one of the strongest options for loud to this day. The key to its strength lies in the 2-second invulnerability window.
                    2 seconds is more than enough time to get into cover when your armor breaks, or even to move between cover, and a 15-second cooldown isn't so long that you only have this ability once in a while. If you are using armorer,
                    you <em>will</em> be abusing the invulnerability, and you will also see great benefit from doing so.

                    When it comes to simple perk decks in Payday 2, it doesn't really get simpler than Armorer. All armorer gives you is 35% extra armor, 20% faster armor recovery rate (half applies to teamates as well), and a 2-second invulnerability window
                    when your armor breaks. Yet, despite the simplicity and despite being one of the original perk decks, it's still one of the strongest options for loud to this day. The key to its strength lies in the 2-second invulnerability window.
                    2 seconds is more than enough time to get into cover when your armor breaks, or even to move between cover, and a 15-second cooldown isn't so long that you only have this ability once in a while. If you are using armorer,
                    you <em>will</em> be abusing the invulnerability, and you will also see great benefit from doing so.
